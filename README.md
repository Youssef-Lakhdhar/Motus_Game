# Motus_Game
Here is a C++ version of the french TV Show "Motus", a game where people have a given number of trials to find a hidden word.

After you selected a difficulty and number of letters, you will have to type words to know if the letters typed are correct (red square), misplaced (yellow circle) or
do not appear in the word (no background).
